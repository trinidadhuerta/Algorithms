"""
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse the digits of the integer.

Example 1:
input: 123
output: 321

Example 2:
input: -123
output: -321

Example 3:
input: 120
output: 21

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
